  This is a version (aka dlmalloc) of malloc/free/realloc written by
  Doug Lea and released to the public domain.  Use, modify, and
  redistribute this code without permission or acknowledgement in any
  way you wish.  Send questions, comments, complaints, performance
  data, etc to dl@cs.oswego.edu

* VERSION 2.7.2 Sat Aug 17 09:07:30 2002  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)

   Note: There may be an updated version of this malloc obtainable at
           ftp://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c
         Check before installing!

* Quickstart

  This library is all in one file to simplify the most common usage:
  ftp it, compile it (-O), and link it into another program. All
  of the compile-time options default to reasonable values for use on
  most unix platforms. Compile -DWIN32 for reasonable defaults on windows.
  You might later want to step through various compile-time and dynamic
  tuning options.

  For convenience, an include file for code using this malloc is at:
     ftp://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc-2.7.1.h
  You don't really need this .h file unless you call functions not
  defined in your system include files.  The .h file contains only the
  excerpts from this file needed for using this malloc on ANSI C/C++
  systems, so long as you haven't changed compile-time options about
  naming and tuning parameters.  If you do, then you can create your
  own malloc.h that does include all settings by cutting at the point
  indicated below.

* Why use this malloc?

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable.
  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good general-purpose
  allocator for malloc-intensive programs.

  The main properties of the algorithms are:
  * For large (>= 512 bytes) requests, it is a pure best-fit allocator,
    with ties normally decided via FIFO (i.e. least recently used).
  * For small (<= 64 bytes by default) requests, it is a caching
    allocator, that maintains pools of quickly recycled chunks.
  * In between, and for combinations of large and small requests, it does
    the best it can trying to meet both goals at once.
  * For very large requests (>= 128KB by default), it relies on system
    memory mapping facilities, if supported.

  For a longer but slightly out of date high-level description, see
     http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

  You may already by default be using a C library containing a malloc
  that is  based on some version of this malloc (for example in
  linux). You might still want to use the one in this file in order to
  customize settings or to avoid overheads associated with library
  versions.

* Contents, described in more detail in "description of public routines" below.

  Standard (ANSI/SVID/...)  functions:
    malloc(size_t n);
    calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size);
    free(Void_t* p);
    realloc(Void_t* p, size_t n);
    memalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
    valloc(size_t n);
    mallinfo()
    mallopt(int parameter_number, int parameter_value)

  Additional functions:
    independent_calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t size, Void_t* chunks[]);
    independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], Void_t* chunks[]);
    pvalloc(size_t n);
    cfree(Void_t* p);
    malloc_trim(size_t pad);
    malloc_usable_size(Void_t* p);
    malloc_stats();

* Vital statistics:

  Supported pointer representation:       4 or 8 bytes
  Supported size_t  representation:       4 or 8 bytes 
       Note that size_t is allowed to be 4 bytes even if pointers are 8.
       You can adjust this by defining INTERNAL_SIZE_T

  Alignment:                              2 * sizeof(size_t) (default)
       (i.e., 8 byte alignment with 4byte size_t). This suffices for
       nearly all current machines and C compilers. However, you can
       define MALLOC_ALIGNMENT to be wider than this if necessary.

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk:   4 or 8 bytes
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden word of overhead holding size
       and status information.

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including 4 overhead)
                          8-byte ptrs:  24/32 bytes (including, 4/8 overhead)

       When a chunk is freed, 12 (for 4byte ptrs) or 20 (for 8 byte
       ptrs but 4 byte size) or 24 (for 8/8) additional bytes are
       needed; 4 (8) for a trailing size field and 8 (16) bytes for
       free list pointers. Thus, the minimum allocatable size is
       16/24/32 bytes.

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.

       The maximum overhead wastage (i.e., number of extra bytes
       allocated than were requested in malloc) is less than or equal
       to the minimum size, except for requests >= mmap_threshold that
       are serviced via mmap(), where the worst case wastage is 2 *
       sizeof(size_t) bytes plus the remainder from a system page (the
       minimal mmap unit); typically 4096 or 8192 bytes.

  Maximum allocated size:  4-byte size_t: 2^32 minus about two pages 
                           8-byte size_t: 2^64 minus about two pages

       It is assumed that (possibly signed) size_t values suffice to
       represent chunk sizes. `Possibly signed' is due to the fact
       that `size_t' may be defined on a system as either a signed or
       an unsigned type. The ISO C standard says that it must be
       unsigned, but a few systems are known not to adhere to this.
       Additionally, even when size_t is unsigned, sbrk (which is by
       default used to obtain memory from system) accepts signed
       arguments, and may not be able to handle size_t-wide arguments
       with negative sign bit.  Generally, values that would
       appear as negative after accounting for overhead and alignment
       are supported only via mmap(), which does not have this
       limitation.

       Requests for sizes outside the allowed range will perform an optional
       failure action and then return null. (Requests may also
       also fail because a system is out of memory.)

  Thread-safety: NOT thread-safe unless USE_MALLOC_LOCK defined

       When USE_MALLOC_LOCK is defined, wrappers are created to
       surround every public call with either a pthread mutex or
       a win32 spinlock (depending on WIN32). This is not
       especially fast, and can be a major bottleneck.
       It is designed only to provide minimal protection
       in concurrent environments, and to provide a basis for
       extensions.  If you are using malloc in a concurrent program,
       you would be far better off obtaining ptmalloc, which is
       derived from a version of this malloc, and is well-tuned for
       concurrent programs. (See http://www.malloc.de) Note that
       even when USE_MALLOC_LOCK is defined, you can can guarantee
       full thread-safety only if no threads acquire memory through 
       direct calls to MORECORE or other system-level allocators.

  Compliance: I believe it is compliant with the 1997 Single Unix Specification
       (See http://www.opennc.org). Also SVID/XPG, ANSI C, and probably 
       others as well.

    M_TRIM_THRESHOLD).  Because top initially
    points to its own bin with initial zero size, thus forcing
    extension on the first malloc request, we avoid having any special
    code in malloc to check whether it even exists yet. But we still
    need to do so when getting memory from system, so we make
    initial_top treat the bin as a legal but unusable chunk during the

  -------------------- Alternative MORECORE functions --------------------

/*
  General Requirements for MORECORE.

  The MORECORE function must have the following properties:

  If MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS is false:

    * MORECORE must allocate in multiples of pagesize. It will
      only be called with arguments that are multiples of pagesize.

    * MORECORE(0) must return an address that is at least 
      MALLOC_ALIGNMENT aligned. (Page-aligning always suffices.)

  else (i.e. If MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS is true):

    * Consecutive calls to MORECORE with positive arguments
      return increasing addresses, indicating that space has been
      contiguously extended. 

    * MORECORE need not allocate in multiples of pagesize.
      Calls to MORECORE need not have args of multiples of pagesize.

    * MORECORE need not page-align.

  In either case:

    * MORECORE may allocate more memory than requested. (Or even less,
      but this will generally result in a malloc failure.)

    * MORECORE must not allocate memory when given argument zero, but
      instead return one past the end address of memory from previous
      nonzero call. This malloc does NOT call MORECORE(0)
      until at least one call with positive arguments is made, so
      the initial value returned is not important.

    * Even though consecutive calls to MORECORE need not return contiguous
      addresses, it must be OK for malloc'ed chunks to span multiple
      regions in those cases where they do happen to be contiguous.

    * MORECORE need not handle negative arguments -- it may instead
      just return MORECORE_FAILURE when given negative arguments.
      Negative arguments are always multiples of pagesize. MORECORE
      must not misinterpret negative args as large positive unsigned
      args. You can suppress all such calls from even occurring by defining
      MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM,

  There is some variation across systems about the type of the
  argument to sbrk/MORECORE. If size_t is unsigned, then it cannot
  actually be size_t, because sbrk supports negative args, so it is
  normally the signed type of the same width as size_t (sometimes
  declared as "intptr_t", and sometimes "ptrdiff_t").  It doesn't much
  matter though. Internally, we use "long" as arguments, which should
  work across all reasonable possibilities.

  Additionally, if MORECORE ever returns failure for a positive
  request, and HAVE_MMAP is true, then mmap is used as a noncontiguous
  system allocator. This is a useful backup strategy for systems with
  holes in address spaces -- in this case sbrk cannot contiguously
  expand the heap, but mmap may be able to map noncontiguous space.

  If you'd like mmap to ALWAYS be used, you can define MORECORE to be
  a function that always returns MORECORE_FAILURE.

  Malloc only has limited ability to detect failures of MORECORE
  to supply contiguous space when it says it can. In particular,
  multithreaded programs that do not use locks may result in
  rece conditions across calls to MORECORE that result in gaps
  that cannot be detected as such, and subsequent corruption.

  If you are using this malloc with something other than sbrk (or its
  emulation) to supply memory regions, you probably want to set
  MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS as false.  As an example, here is a custom
  allocator kindly contributed for pre-OSX macOS.  It uses virtually
  but not necessarily physically contiguous non-paged memory (locked
  in, present and won't get swapped out).  You can use it by
  uncommenting this section, adding some #includes, and setting up the
  appropriate defines above:

      #define MORECORE osMoreCore
      #define MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS 0

  There is also a shutdown routine that should somehow be called for
  cleanup upon program exit.

  #define MAX_POOL_ENTRIES 100
  #define MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE  (64 * 1024)
  static int next_os_pool;
  void *our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES];

  void *osMoreCore(int size)
  {
    void *ptr = 0;
    static void *sbrk_top = 0;

    if (size > 0)
    {
      if (size < MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE)
         size = MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE;
      if (CurrentExecutionLevel() == kTaskLevel)
         ptr = PoolAllocateResident(size + RM_PAGE_SIZE, 0);
      if (ptr == 0)
      {
        return (void *) MORECORE_FAILURE;
      }
      // save ptrs so they can be freed during cleanup
      our_os_pools[next_os_pool] = ptr;
      next_os_pool++;
      ptr = (void *) ((((CHUNK_SIZE_T) ptr) + RM_PAGE_MASK) & ~RM_PAGE_MASK);
      sbrk_top = (char *) ptr + size;
      return ptr;
    }
    else if (size < 0)
    {
      // we don't currently support shrink behavior
      return (void *) MORECORE_FAILURE;
    }
    else
    {
      return sbrk_top;
    }
  }

  // cleanup any allocated memory pools
  // called as last thing before shutting down driver

  void osCleanupMem(void)
  {
    void **ptr;

    for (ptr = our_os_pools; ptr < &our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES]; ptr++)
      if (*ptr)
      {
         PoolDeallocate(*ptr);
         *ptr = 0;

        no scheme using them consistently outperforms those that don't
        given above changes.

      * Scan 2 returns chunks (not just 1)
      * Propagate failure in realloc if malloc returns 0
      * Add stuff to allow compilation on non-ANSI compilers

          Detlefs & Zorn comparison study (in SIGPLAN Notices.)

    Trial version Fri Aug 28 13:14:29 1992  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)
      * Based loosely on libg++-1.2X malloc. (It retains some of the overall
         structure of old version,  but most details differ.)

Prolog Unit Tests
=================


---++ TBD

	* Add options to test units
		- Condition, setup, cleanup, blocked [OK]
	* Run the tests on make, etc.  [OK]
	* Report generation options

---++ What to do with loaded tests?

	* Keep them around
	* Remove them
	* Flag module as `volatile', so it is not saved.

---++ Distinguish user/system/library tests

---++ Deal with seperate test-files:

	* load_test_files(+Options)

---++ Volatile modules?

---++ Conversion of system tests:

	- test.pl internals [OK]
	- scripts called from test.pl [OK]
	- tests for packages

---++ Run tests concurrently?

	+ Tests applications for concurrent execution
	+ Saves time, notably on tests doing networking, timeout, etc.
	- Might be more complicated to understand

---++ Test wizard

	* Write tests to .plt files
	* Merge with existing content of .plt files
		- Read with comments and write back?

---++ Coverage analysis

	* See cover.pl

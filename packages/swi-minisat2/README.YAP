This is the minisat package as described in 

Michael Codish, Vitaly Lagoon, Peter J. Stuckey: Logic programming
with satisfiability. TPLP 8(1): 121-128 (2008)

We thank the authors for kindly allowing us to use this package in YAP.

Please check the examples in $install/share/Yap/minisat/examples and
the TPLP paper to understand how the system can be used.

Last, please contact yap-users AT sf.net for any bugs first, as they
may have been caused by the YAP port.
